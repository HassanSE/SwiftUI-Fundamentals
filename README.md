# SwiftUI-Fundamentals
An entry level course from Sean Allen on SwiftUI

## Key points
- Everything in SwiftUI is a `View`.
- Each modifier wraps the original view in another view.
- This is why order of the modifiers matters.
- Compared to UIKit, views are so cheap in SwiftUI that they are destroyed and recreated all the time.
-  10 is the max amount of subviews you can have in SwiftUI.
